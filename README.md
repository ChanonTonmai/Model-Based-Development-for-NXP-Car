# Model Based Development for NXP Car
This project is called AMAS which is stand for Annual Meeting Student on Automotive Embedded System.
This meeting is run by Toyota Tsusho Electronic Thailand and Thailand Embedded System Association 
for inspired undergraduate student to understand how important of electric vehicle and disruptive innovation.

The AMAS project is a global engineering multilevel competition where student teams build, program and race an intelligent autonomous model car around tracks which have points on each track. The competition aims to deepen studentâ€™s knowledge about embedded control systems design using Model-Based design and Advanced Driver Assistance System via automatic break.

During the design phase students must tackle several Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) related issues such as embedded microcontroller programming, communication control, modeling and implementation, as well as overall vehicle dynamics (physics). Soft skills are also trained through team collaboration, communication and project management.

Instead of detailed algorithm description, in this paper we try to show how to use a model based design and intuitive approaches for successful implementation of the controller algorithm.
